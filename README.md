# learning_process
Main libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. In this repository I have analyzed learning process in SkillBox. 
As a result I have received information for improving the learning process: 
1) Some statistics data about learning process (like count of courses in dataset, count of modules in every course, count of lessons in every module in every course); 
2) Potential workload of teachers; 
3) Problematic modules.
